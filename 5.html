	<font color="#cc3300">The Grand Final of the World Cup was on this very date. On this very day England lifted their maiden World Cup title after winning the match on the boundary count back rule. The scores were tied so were the scores of Super Over.</font>

	<h3>Teams and toss</h3>
<p><font color="#cc3300">Both teams remained unchanged from their semi-final matches; New Zealand decided that the line-up that beat India against the odds would work in their favour in the final, while England's Jason Roy avoided suspension after his show of dissent in their semi-final match against Australia to open the batting for the hosts.</font></p>

<p><font color="#cc3300">Some early rain slightly delayed the toss, with the match starting at 10:45, 15 minutes later than scheduled. It was feared that the rain would interfere with the match, but it cleared up quickly, although the overcast conditions and wet grass changed the dynamic of the toss. New Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first.</font></p>

<h3>New Zealand innings</h3>
<p><font color="#cc3300">Martin Guptill and Henry Nicholls opened the innings for New Zealand, with Nicholls scoring his first half-century of the tournament.[24] A further 30 runs from captain Kane Williamson, and 47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham, helped New Zealand to a total of 241/8 from their 50 overs. Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett took three wickets each for the hosts.</font></p>

<h3>England innings</h3>

<p>
<font color="#cc3300">Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England's top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over; however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught. But with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes hit a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket, bringing their score to 233/8.</font></p>

<p><font color="#cc3300">From the third-last ball of the final over, Stokes drove the ball into mid-wicket. Guptill fielded the ball and threw it back to the striker's end as Stokes was returning to complete a second run; however, as Stokes dived for the crease, the ball deflected off his bat and to the boundary behind the wicket, resulting in four runs being added to the two that Stokes had run. The final two deliveries went for a run each, but England lost their last two wickets going for a second run each time.</font></p>

<h3>Super Over</h3>
<p><font color="#cc3300">With the scores tied at 241, the match went to a Super Over. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult's bowling to accumulate 15 runs without loss, with both batsmen contributing a boundary four. For New Zealand, Guptill and Neesham went up to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. Archer's over started badly, beginning with a wide, and a steady accumulation of runs, along with a six from Neesham off the third ball, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery. Facing his first ball of the Super Over and the last of the match, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one, and Guptill was run out well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs, the Super Over tied, but England's superior boundary count (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time in four final appearances. Stokes earned Man of the Match honours with his unbeaten 84, plus seven runs in the Super Over</font></p>
