	<font color="#cc3300">The 2019 World Cup was hosted in England. The teams went through many ups and downs in the group stage. The stadiums were iconic and cricket was experienced in the most supreme form at the home of cricket at the LORD'S. But a drawback was England's weather and rain distrupted many of the games including the semi-finals between New-Zealand and India.</font>

	<h2 id="5">INDIA</h2>
	<p> <font color="#cc3300">India had performed brilliantly in the group stage and was leading the points table despite playing one match less. But a major catastrophe struck the team in the semi-finals when the top order collaped early. Dhoni and Jadeja showed India hope but the tragic run-out of Dhoni at the wrong time disheartened many India fans. Despite Jadeja's excellent knock of 77 runs, India was defeated by 18 runs.</font> </p>
